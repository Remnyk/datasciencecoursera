===================

The run_analysis.R script contains the code I used to create a tidy data of the means and standard deviations of feautures in the smartphone activity recognition data. It contains brief comments describing subsequent lines of code.
The process follows line by line from first to last.

The run_analysis CodeBook contains a detailed explanation of the process performed by the R scirpt. It explains all the variables used in the script, followed by a description of the transformations and changes performed by the code.

Using the run_analysis scipt and codebook will allow you to get the final tidy data set ```finFrameDT``` present in the script.
